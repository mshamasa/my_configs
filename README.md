This is my basic mac setup for dev 
 - iTerm2 (with oh-my-zsh and antigen)
 - tmux

## Setup a new Mac
  - xcode-select --install (later install xcode from app store)
  - install homebrew
  - install iTerm2
  - install Zsh
  - install Oh My Zsh (configuration manager for zsh)
  - install `antigen` to manage packages for zsh
